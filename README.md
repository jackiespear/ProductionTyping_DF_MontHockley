# A production effect and directed forgetting effect experiment
### A jsPsych experiment - Categorized Lists from Montagliani & Hockley, 2019

This is recognition production effect and directed forgetting experiment with semantically similar words from categorized lists.

Participants are randomly assigned to do a production effect or direceted forgetting experiment. From there, they are then randomly assigned to a pure read/forget condition, a pure produce/remember condition, or a mixed-list condition. Next, whether participants are cued to produce/remember or read/forget during the presentation of the item, or after the presentation of the item, is randomized. Lastly, one of four conterbalanced study lists are randomly selected for presentation. Thus, there are 48 unique conditions. 

On trials where participants are instructed to produce/remember, words will be presented in green. On trails where participants are instructed to read/forget, words will be presented in red. Production is accomplished by typing, and typing is recorded, but not mirrored to the screen. After the study phase, participants will be given a standard yes/no recognition test, for all of the words that they studied, with an equal amount of words that they did not study.
